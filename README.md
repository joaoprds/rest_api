Hello my friend

in this project i'm just tranning and learning about node.js, REST API and Docker

So if you want a test this repository you need first of all:

install docker on your machine
Install node.js on your machine 

And in your terminal you need run this command :
1 => docker-compose build
2 => docker-compose up 

So is this . 

Thanks for your appreciate .
